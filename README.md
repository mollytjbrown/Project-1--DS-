# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

How should Microsoft expect their budget to affect their profit when producing a film? 

## Investigation:

1. what relationship does the production budget of a film have to its domestic profit?
2. What is the average budget to profit relationship for all movies?
3. What is the average budget to profit relationship for the ten highest earners?
4. What is the average budget to profit relationship for the movies with the ten highest budgets?

## Final Project Summary

Microsoft wants to be in the category of top ten earners without necessariy being in the top ten highest budgets. Is this possible? 
The relationship between profit and budget seems to be touchy, and Microsoft should make an attempt to ultimately land in the sweet spot of highest earning movies, without spending grotesquely more than necessary. 

# The Data Used:

In the folder ('zipped data'), I used two dataframes:
1. bom.movie_gross.csv.gz
2. tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz


### What relationship does the production budget of a film have to its domestic profit for all movies?

Correlation Coefficient = .68
Average production budget = $27,557,245
Average domestic profit = $36,608,449
Difference = $9,051,204

Average profit return per dollar budgeted = $1.33


### What is the average budget to profit relationship for the ten highest earners?

Correlation Coefficient: .79
Average Production Budget: $201,400,000
Average Domestic Profit: $601,449,876
Difference: $400,049,876

Average Profit Return per dollar budgeted: $2.99

### What is the average budget to profit relationship for the movies with the ten highest budgets?

Correlation Coefficient: .35
Average Production Budget: $289,300,000
Average Domestic Profit: $430,092,156
Difference: $140,792,156

Average Profit Return per dollar budgeted: $1.48

## What can Microsoft Take Away? 

Overal, budget and profit have a moderately strong correlation of .68. 
Does this mean that the higher the budget, the higher the profit? Not necessarily.
We saw the highest profits at an average of a $200,000,000 budget, but the highest budgets overall had an average of about $300,000,000. 
To conclude, the highest profits =/= highest budgets. 
Microsoft should take a look into other production factors such as: 
1. Genre
2. Crew
3. Advertising/marketing 
4. Historical Relevance
